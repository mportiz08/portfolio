## Skills

### Development

I'm an experienced developer who has a [passion](http://resume.marcusortiz.com/#open-source) for the open source community. My favorite languages to write in are [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) and [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/). I specialize in developing software for the web, and my favorite frameworks to work with are [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), and [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).

Other programming languages I have experience with:

  * c
  * java

### Design

I may be a developer first, but I like to think that I have an eye for design as well, specifically when it comes to the web. I love writing clean HTML5 markup and CSS3 styles that look minimal and elegant.
